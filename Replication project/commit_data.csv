openstack/puppet-cinder,manifests/keystone/auth.pp,"Deploy block-storage service type

The official service type name defined in service type authority is
not volume or volumevN but ""block-storage"". In the recent discussion[1]
it was recommended that a keystone service with that official name is
created along with optional service types with legacy names.
